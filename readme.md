*Proposal*

A futuristic fish tank that acts as a music visualizer

I wish to create a futuristic fish tank in unity.
 - There will be fish to be inside the fish tank moving there fins and around the tank on generated path.
 - Music will be playing.
 - The appearence of the tank along with the lighting change in beat with the music.
 - The fish to will adjust movement depedning on a generated path.
 - The tank will be decorated randomly on every start of the project.
 - There will be a submarine you can eneter to move around the tank and view it in first person.
 - The fish should avoid this submarine.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
